A quick hacked together project to test out my two npm packages.

## About
- Uses alexs-redux-fetch to handle api calls/storing entities
- Fails 2/3 times to demonstrate optimistic updates as well as retrying and cancelling a failed request. 

## Usage

### Getting Started
```js
git clone git@github.com:AlexRobinson-/redux-fetch-example.git
cd redux-fetch-example
yarn
yarn start
```
